# Discord_Bot
This bot is made to help learn programming techniques and to keep information fresh in my head. I expect the functionality of the bot to improve over time as I become a better programmer.

## Prerequisities
This bot uses discord.py available at https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/index.html

## Using the bot
When you run the program it will ask you for your bot's token. Once a token is given the bot should be logged into discord's servers and you can interact with it in any server it's currently in.
